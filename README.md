This project was forked from [Customers](https://github.com/vincelawdev/Customers), which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The directory structure follows a similar style to [React Boilerplate's](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/tree/master/app) directory structure.

[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was used to simplify the Redux setup process.

[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [Redux Hooks](https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks) were used to simplify the Redux binding code and promote the use of functional components over class components.
